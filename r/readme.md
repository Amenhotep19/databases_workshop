# Databases in R

You will need the `RPostgreSQL` package in R for the materials here, as well as access to a PostgreSQL server.  The examples here use the database from the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/).

NOTE: materials still in progress.  Will be done by Sept. 11.

[Visualization and Databases in R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/08/16/visualizations-with-r-and-databases/): good discusion and examples of how to do visualizations of data that lives in a database without pulling it all into R first

[Working with Databases in RStudio](http://db.rstudio.com/): features of RStudio, and packages created by RStudio, to help you work with databases in R; some of the features discussed are only available in development versions of RStudio at this point.
