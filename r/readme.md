[Visualization and Databases in R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/08/16/visualizations-with-r-and-databases/): good discusion and examples of how to do visualizations of data that lives in a database without pulling it all into R first

[Working with Databases in RStudio](http://db.rstudio.com/): features of RStudio, and packages created by RStudio, to help you work with databases in R; some of the features discussed are only available in development versions of RStudio at this point.

[Databases Using R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/05/17/databases-using-r/) by Edgar Ruiz is an up-to-date overview
