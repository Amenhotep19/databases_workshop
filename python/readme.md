# Databases in Python

You will need the `psycopg2` package for Python for the materials here, as well as access to a PostgreSQL server.  The examples here use the database from the [PostgreSQL Tutorial](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/).

[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/): another Python library used extensively by developers.  There's a steep learning curve for this library (at least for the advanced features), but if you'll be doing a lot of database work from Python, it's worth a look.

[Guide to SQLite in Python](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_sqlite_in_python_tutorial.html): If you want to try SQLite instead (a good option if you're working on a project on your own with a relatively small database), here's a place to start.
